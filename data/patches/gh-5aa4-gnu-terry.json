The people on the Clacks honor their deceased by sending their names with this code around their system. Because so stated in the book: \"A man is not dead while his name is still spoken.\" Thus, \"GNU Terry\" means the name of the author (which is deceased) should be forever transmitted.\n\nThe image also depicts a recurring Discworld character, the Death of Rats (aka the Grim Squeaker), a skeletal rat wearing a dark robe and carrying a tiny scythe.",
